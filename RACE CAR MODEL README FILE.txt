So,here's the 3d scene of a racing car model.I basically used 2 scripts-
1.For Third Person Camera View
2.For Car Movement

For Third Person Camera View ,I used code instead of Cinemachine.

So the car has 5 buttons ,W -> Move forward,S -> Move Backward,D -> Move Right,L -> Move Left,Space ->Brake

I used Unity Physics into it such as RigidBody,WheelCollider,Box Collider;Made a general terrain and road system for the race game.
